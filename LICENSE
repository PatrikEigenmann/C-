GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software
and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License
is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions
of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you
wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that
you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these
rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you
received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this license.
Thus, both users and developers win.

For developers' sake, the GPL version 3 improves on the previous version
by making it easier to use, improving compatibility with other licenses,
and clarifying the license terms.

We have tried to keep this license document short and simple, so that
you can understand it and know your rights. We have also used a plain
English style throughout, avoiding legal jargon where possible.

If you have any questions about your rights under this License, or about
how to use it, please contact the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

We have made a version of the GNU General Public License, which has
terms to make it easier to use in other licenses without conflict. If you
want to use this license in your own programs, please refer to the
GNU General Public License v3.0 or later.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distributing, and modifying
this License are found in the LICENSE file.
